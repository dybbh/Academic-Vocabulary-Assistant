## Overview
Many students struggle with complex academic vocabulary in textbooks, research papers, and online resources. The **Academic Vocabulary Assistant** is a digital tool designed to simplify learning by providing instant, easy-to-understand definitions in a **“word = meaning”** style.

This tool aims to improve reading comprehension, learning efficiency, and confidence for students globally.

## Problem
- Academic texts often contain **complex or technical words**.  
- Existing dictionaries are slow, cumbersome, or overly detailed.  
- Students spend too much time searching for meanings, slowing their study.  
- Few tools integrate **word explanations directly into reading platforms** like browsers, PDFs, or e-books.

## Solution
The Academic Vocabulary Assistant can be implemented as:  
- **Browser extension** (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)  
- **Desktop app** (PDFs, e-books, Word, Google Docs)  
- **Mobile app** for reading on-the-go  

**Key Features:**  
1. **Highlight-to-define:** Select a word to see its meaning instantly.  
2. **“Word = meaning” style:** Simple, concise definitions.  
3. **Personal dictionary:** Save and review learned words.  
4. **Cross-platform support:** Web, desktop, and mobile.  
5. **AI assistance:** Dynamically generate meanings for unknown words.  
6. **Offline support:** Common words can be accessed without internet.

## Example
When a student highlights a word, the tool shows the meaning instantly:

| Word | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| framework | structured method |
| risk mitigation | reducing danger |
| complement | adds something useful |
| asset | something valuable |
| occurrence | something that happens |
| implement | put into action / carry out |
| capabilities | skills or abilities |
| resilience | ability to recover or stay strong |
| generalised | made broad or applied to many situations |
| nuances | small differences or subtle details |

*Example Usage:*  
Highlight **“resilience”** in a textbook → Popup shows:  
`resilience = ability to recover or stay strong`
